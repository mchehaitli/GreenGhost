# Theme Migration Guide

To migrate your theme, we need the following files from your previous website:

## Required Files:
1. CSS Variables and Base Styles
   - index.css or similar file containing CSS variables
   - Any global styles or base styling rules

2. Tailwind Configuration
   - tailwind.config.js or tailwind.config.ts
   - Any custom color schemes, spacing, or other theme extensions

3. Theme Configuration
   - theme.json if you were using one
   - Any other theme configuration files

These files will allow us to:
- Match your color scheme and styling variables
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Keep your theme preferences and variants
