The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is caused by a non-zero exit code during the build script execution.

**Solution:**
1. Update the browserslist data by running the command suggested in the error message:
   ```
   npx update-browserslist-db@latest
   ```
2. Rerun the build to see if the issue is resolved.

If the issue persists, it might be related to a specific dependency. In that case:
1. Run `npm audit` to check for any vulnerabilities in the dependencies.
2. Review the dependencies and make necessary updates or changes based on the audit results.

Ensure that the browserslist data is updated regularly to prevent future issues.
