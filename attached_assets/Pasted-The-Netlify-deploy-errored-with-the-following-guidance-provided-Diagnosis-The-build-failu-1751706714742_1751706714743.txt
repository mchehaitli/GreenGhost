The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to a non-zero exit code returned during the 'building site' stage of the build process.

**Solution:**
1. **Node Version Mismatch:**
   - The logs show that Node version 20.19.3 is being downloaded and installed. This version of Node does not exist, indicating an incorrect version specified in the build configuration.
   - Update the Node.js version to a valid version. Ensure that the version specified is compatible with the project requirements.
   - Link to the documentation for [changing Node versions](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript) for guidance on managing Node.js versions in the build process. 

2. **Verify Package and Commit Files:**
   - Before changing the Node.js version, verify that the required Node.js version is correctly specified in the project configuration files. 
   - Ensure that the necessary Node.js version is added to `package.json` or wherever the Node.js version is configured.
   - Confirm that any files related to the Node.js version configuration are committed to the repository to reflect the correct setup in the build process.
