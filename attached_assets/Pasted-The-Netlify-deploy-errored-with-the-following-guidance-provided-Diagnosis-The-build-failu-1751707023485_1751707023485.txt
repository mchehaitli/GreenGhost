The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is caused by a dependency resolution issue where the versions of `date-fns` required by different packages conflict with each other.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the conflicting versions of `date-fns` (`^4.1.0` and `^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0`) are both needed in the project and ensure they are correctly specified in the `package.json` file.
2. Try fixing the dependency conflict by running the build command with the `--force` flag or `--legacy-peer-deps` flag. You can add these flags to the build command in the Netlify configuration.
3. If step 2 doesn't resolve the issue, consider updating the packages causing the conflict to versions that are compatible with each other.
4. If necessary, you can add `date-fns` as an external package in the Vite configuration if it's not already included. However, ensure that the package is in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository before making this change.
