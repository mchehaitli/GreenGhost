The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to an error in the build process. Specifically, the error is related to resolving the import "canvas-confetti" in the file "WelcomeAnimation.tsx".

### Solution
To resolve this issue:
1. Verify that the package "canvas-confetti" is included in the `package.json` file or has been committed to the repository.
2. If the package is part of the project but needs to be externalized, add it to the `build.rollupOptions.external` configuration. This will prevent Rollup from trying to bundle it and avoid runtime issues.

After verifying the presence of "canvas-confetti" in your project or repository, add it to the `build.rollupOptions.external` configuration to ensure a successful build.

For more details on managing dependencies in Rollup and Vite, you can refer to the [Rollup documentation](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#big-list-of-options) and the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
