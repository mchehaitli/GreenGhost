The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis

[line 17](#L17): The build failed with a non-zero exit code 2 during the 'building site' stage.

[line 75](#L75) to [line 89](#L89): The specific error is related to loading the PostCSS config and encountering a "Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'" error.

### Solution

The error occurs because the build is unable to find the 'tailwindcss' module as part of PostCSS config.

1. Verify that 'tailwindcss' is listed as a dependency in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
2. If 'tailwindcss' is in the `package.json` file, ensure it is installed before running the build commands.

If 'tailwindcss' is a development dependency, it should be listed under `devDependencies` in the `package.json` file. You can install missing dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss
```

After verifying and ensuring the presence of 'tailwindcss', you can retry the build to resolve this issue.
