The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to the command `vite build` not being found, leading to an exit code of 127.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that Vite is listed as a dependency in the `package.json` file or committed to the repository.
2. If Vite is a dependency, ensure it is included in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` of the `package.json`.
3. If Vite is not part of the project dependencies, add it by running `npm install vite --save-dev` to install Vite as a dev dependency.
4. After adding Vite to the project dependencies, retry the build to see if the issue is resolved.
