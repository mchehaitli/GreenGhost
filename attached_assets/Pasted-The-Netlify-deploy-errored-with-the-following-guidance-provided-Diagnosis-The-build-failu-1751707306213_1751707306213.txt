The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to a missing module (`tailwindcss`) while loading the PostCSS config, leading to a non-zero exit code during the build process.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that `tailwindcss` is listed as a dependency in the `package.json` file of the project.
2. Ensure that `tailwindcss` is committed to the repository.
3. Add `tailwindcss` to the `external` configuration, if needed.

By following these steps, the build should be able to locate the `tailwindcss` module and complete successfully.
