The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed during the 'building site' stage with a non-zero exit code.

**Solution:**
1. Check the build script to identify the cause of the non-zero exit code. It seems there might be an issue with the build script related to the Vite framework.
2. Ensure that all the necessary build dependencies are correctly set up and configured.
3. Verify if the Vite framework is properly installed and configured in the project.

Since there are no explicit errors related to Node.js version mismatches in the logs provided, if you encounter such issues, make sure to refer to the documentation for [changing Node versions](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript).
