# Waitlist Verification Flow Bug Report

## Issue Description
The waitlist signup flow is not working as expected. After submitting the email and zip code, the system shows a success message prematurely without requiring the verification code input, despite sending a verification email.

## Expected Behavior
1. User enters email and zip code in the waitlist dialog
2. System sends verification email with 4-digit code
3. Dialog switches to verification code input screen
4. User must enter the verification code to complete signup
5. Only after successful verification should the success message appear and dialog close

## Current Behavior
1. User enters email and zip code
2. System sends verification email
3. Success message appears immediately, bypassing verification
4. Verification code input is never shown

## Technical Details
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Components: WaitlistDialog.tsx handling the signup flow
- Backend: Express.js with PostgreSQL
- Relevant Files:
  - client/src/components/WaitlistDialog.tsx
  - server/routes/waitlist.ts
  - server/services/email.ts

## API Flow
1. POST /api/waitlist (Initial signup)
   - Expected Response: { status: 'pending_verification', message: '...' }
2. POST /api/waitlist/verify (Code verification)
   - Expected Response: { success: true, message: '...' }

Please help fix this issue by ensuring the proper sequence of steps is followed and the verification code must be entered before showing success.
